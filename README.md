# ProcessingRandomColorPaletteGeneration
A collection of functions to generate random color palettes in Processing (and p5.js).

I created this pde file some years ago for a personal project.
This is the same file I used back then, it should still work!

I also added a p5.js version, even if it has not been tested it thoroughly ;)
